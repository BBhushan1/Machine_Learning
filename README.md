Heart Disease Prediction

📌 Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health parameters. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health indicators such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, age, and other medical attributes.

🛠️ Installation

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction

2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`



📊 Dataset

The dataset used for training comes from the UCI Heart Disease dataset, available here. It includes features such as:

Age

Sex

Chest pain type

Resting blood pressure

Serum cholesterol

Fasting blood sugar

Resting electrocardiographic results

Maximum heart rate achieved

Exercise-induced angina

Oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise)

Slope of the peak exercise ST segment

Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy

Thalassemia


🏗️ Model Details

The model is trained using algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Neural Networks (optional)

Performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
